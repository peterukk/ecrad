GPTL version info: 8.0.2
GPTL was built without threading
HAVE_LIBMPI was false
HAVE_PAPI was true
  PAPI event multiplexing was OFF
Description of printed events (PAPI and derived):
  DP operations
  

PAPI events enabled (including those required for derived events):
  PAPI_DP_OPS

ENABLE_NESTEDOMP was false
Autoprofiling capability was enabled with backtrace
Underlying timing routine was gettimeofday.
GPTLget_overhead: using hash entry 4=section_5 for getentry estimate
Total overhead of 1 GPTL start or GPTLstop call=7.6e-08 seconds
Components are as follows:
Fortran layer:             0.0e+00 =   0.0% of total
Get thread number:         4.0e-09 =   5.3% of total
Generate hash index:       5.0e-09 =   6.6% of total
Find hashtable entry:      6.0e-09 =   7.9% of total
Underlying timing routine: 2.9e-08 =  38.2% of total
Misc start/stop functions: 3.0e-09 =   3.9% of total
Read PAPI counters:        2.9e-08 =  38.2% of total

Overhead of backtrace (invoked once per auto-instrumented start entry)=2.579e-06 seconds
NOTE: If GPTL is called from C not Fortran, the 'Fortran layer' overhead is zero
NOTE: For calls to GPTLstart_handle()/GPTLstop_handle(), the 'Generate hash index' overhead is zero
NOTE: For auto-instrumented calls, the cost of generating the hash index plus finding
      the hashtable entry is 0.0e+00 not the 1.1e-08 portion taken by GPTLstart
NOTE: Each hash collision roughly doubles the 'Find hashtable entry' cost of that timer

If overhead stats are printed, they are the columns labeled self_OH and parent_OH
self_OH is estimated as 2X the Fortran layer cost (start+stop) plust the cost of 
a single call to the underlying timing routine.
parent_OH is the overhead for the named timer which is subsumed into its parent.
It is estimated as the cost of a single GPTLstart()/GPTLstop() pair.
Print method was most_frequent.

If a '%_of' field is present, it is w.r.t. the first timer for thread 0.
If a 'e6_per_sec' field is present, it is in millions of PAPI counts per sec.

A '*' in column 1 below means the timer had multiple parents, though the values
printed are for all calls. Multiple parent stats appear later in the file in the
section titled 'Multiple parent info'
A '!' in column 1 means the timer is currently ON and the printed timings are only
valid as of the previous GPTLstop. '!' overrides '*' if the region had multiple
parents and was currently ON.
